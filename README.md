# clinic-managment-system

This is just a basic incomplete clinic management system. The system has most of the stuff needed implemented based on the software engineering design made for it but has no forms at all.

This is just an experimental project that was dumped midway and made in less than 4 hours so feel free to complete it on your own.

The class diagram that it was built on:
